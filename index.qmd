# Me 👋

Hi there! 

I am a data scientist who has been around for a while. I've built 🛠️ solutions for sectors ranging from ✈️ aerospace to 🏥 insurance. I've worked in areas like insurance fraud detection, satellite image segmentation, engine failure prediction, among others. Checkout my resume for more!

I am passionate about AI, and the way it is changing our world. This is why I love to keep on top of the latest advances - Stable Diffusion, Transformers, RecSys, MLOps, etc. Some of it I try to share back through my blog, where I write everything about AI that is churning in my brain.

When I'm not doing tech, I love to sing 🎤, and read 📙, and scribble ✏️ once in a while. I love history and the classics as well.
