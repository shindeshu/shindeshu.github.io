Traditionally, you could make up basic if-else rules that incorporate business logic to get a value for a house price.

    "\n",
    "![.](assets/structure.jpg){width=40%}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll expand on what are these skills, and how do you go about acquiring them, and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python**: For a beginner, the first step should be to learn how to code. Python is the most used language in this space, and it is great language for a first-time coder to learn. In fact, the ease of coding is exactly the reason why python came to dominate the machine learning landscape. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=5717s) is a good free resource to start learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basics of the language are enough to get started- you don't need to leetcode yourself. You do need to get a hang of jupyter notebooks, an IDE like VS-Code, and be able to install packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tabular vs Deep Learning**: As a newcomer, you should aim to get proficient in tabular data before you move to tackling image or text datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**: Knowing pandas (library that handles tabular data) and matplotlib/seaborn (data visualization library) is another starting step. Knowing basic methods is enough at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have warmed up, we'll step into the main process and discuss the sources to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem Of Plenty\n",
    "\n",
    "Where to learn from? There is just so much to choose, so many courses, books, websites, twitter influencers, linkedin influencers, an overflowing bookmarks folder, pdfs of unread papers. The progress is overwhelming too- What's a standard practice a year ago may not be the same today.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be overwhelming for a veteran, let alone a beginner. Separating the noise from the signal can be daunting, as well as finding the best possible source to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking from experience, what works best for me is learning on the job. Whatever projects I've worked on, that knowledge stays with me forever. Courses and Books are tougher to retain. So if you're employed, give your best in your own project, it's the best way to upskill.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you're not employed, or your job is narrow in its scope and you want to upskill, the problem persists. There should be a process to identify and follow the materials. (My personal recommendations are at the end of this post.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Courses**: Instead of sampling and browsing dozens of courses, it is better to simply pick one and get started. The time you waste in finding the perfect course can be better utilized in completing an okay course. Most important thing is to get moving and not be stagnant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Books**: There are some books that are structured as tutorials. Don't delve deep into theory at this stage, if a book contains code snippets, is a latest copy, and is easy to read - that's the one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Websites and Blogs**: Keeping browsing medium, towardsdatascience, kdnuggets, etc. Keep it light."

    "![Learn by Doing! *Image by mastervector on freepik*](assets/blacksmith.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two blocks are in place, the coding environment and the theory of data science. DS is a very practice-oriented discipline. Theoretical knowledge constitutes a small proportion of the data scientist mindspace. It is in the dirty trenches of the notebooks where the real are proven.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your resume contains just a bunch of courses, it does not give an interviewer any idea of your prowess. But having a project, notebooks, repos is a sign that you have been there and done those things that matter the most. What things, you ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading data, understanding, cleaning, processing, preparing is the single most important aspect of data science that is often not given the necessary important even by those long in the game. These skills cannot be taught in any course or book, but be learned by doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a term you'll come across quite often, and it is an art more than a science, another skill that you'll learn through practice. Understanding the contents of your data, asking it the right questions and making it answer, this is our bread and butter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are feature engineering, dealing with imbalanced data, model training, model evaluation, all skills which are practical in nature. Fortunately for us, there is a single place to learn all of the above- **Kaggle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle is a website where you can train machine learning models for free using many datasets available there. (It also hosts competitions, but at this point we are focussed on learning). Simply copy-and-editing someone else's publicly available notebooks can be incredibly helpful to understand various work flows. Spend your time creating a chimaera of a dozen code blocks from dozen notebooks in a single task, and it will be exponentially helpful from a learning perspective.\n",

    "### Don't Heed the Kaggle Haters\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been criticism about Kaggle that it is not helpful for a data science job, since you always get a clean dataset in hand which is never the case in real life. While it is true that real life data is much messier than Kaggle, practicing in Kaggle has much more returns than handicap. You learn to max out your feature engineering skills, data visualization and EDA skills, and are also able to learn how to rapid iterations. Kaggle is helpful without a doubt.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also get to learn about the latest techniques, libraries, models, you observe empirical evidence on what methods work and what don't. "
