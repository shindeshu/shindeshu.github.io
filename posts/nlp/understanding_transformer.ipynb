With ChatGPT and Bing AI, the quality of machine generated text has shattered everyone's projections about artificial intelligence. However, what's fascinating that the underlying architecture that has enabled all these advancements in NLP is relatively quite simple and easy to understand. In this post, we'll try to understand it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many people do have an understanding of RNNs / LSTMs, probably since they've been around for a long time, they're a part of many a coursework, etc. And hence they try to understand transformers from that angle, as sort of a natural evolution. However transformers are extremely different from sequential models because they, well, are not sequential models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequential models, we have units one after another, in a chain. Each unit/word has direct access to information of only the preceding unit/word. This is limiting - dependencies between words at different positions is not modelled well. For sequence-to-sequence prediction, the entirety of input is encoded in a single vector, and the decoder is supposed to decode everything from that. This causes information loss because all of it is crushed into a single vector. Transformer solves both of these issues and more.\n",

    "Now let’s understand a simpler situation that’s kinda analogous to self-attention- you simply multiply the inputs with a matrix (in other words, pass through a linear layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say the input sequence is of 8 words, and the vocabulary is of 1000. Then, we will first map each word to a embedding vector of 32, which is going to be our embedding dimension. This is like the word embedding of each word. Here, T = 8, and C = 32. Hence, our input is a matrix of [8 x 1000], which will be projected to [8 x 32].\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that W is our weights matrix of size TxT. Each element of it is a weight that corresponds to every single word to every other word, including towards itself (the diagonal elements). We can simply multiply it with our embedding matrix like this → [T, T] x [T, 32] → [T, 32], this being our updated representation! \n",

Finally, v is passed through a linear layer to get the output of the single transformer block.\n",

The first person, which is you, wants some advice (say, college admission). Here, query is a vector from you (what do I do?). All other people return keys to you (here's what I say), and you compute a weights vector corresponding to your query and the keys. Finally you weigh the final decision (objectively, here's the answer) based on these weights. Other people will similarly have their own questions.

    "## Transformer Components\n",
    "\n",
    "With self-attention out of the way, let’s move on to the entire transformer tower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Transformers\n",
    "There can two be components - Encoder, and a Decoder. This is a sequence-to-sequence model, used for tasks like machine translation (which was the topic of intereset of the original transformer paper). However, there can be encoder-only transformers geared towards text understanding and applications like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, etc. BERT is an example of encoder-model. There can also be decoder-only models like GPT which are geared towards production of text given a small input. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "Encoding component is actually six encoders, stacked on top of each other. They have the same structure, but they do not share weights. Each encoder has two parts - Self-Attention and Feed-Forward Neural Network. The FFNN weights are same for all words, for a given encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoding Component too has these two components, but an extra one in the middle - Encoder-Decoder attention to focus on the encodings. For an encoder-decoder attention block, the K&V matrices come from the last encoder block, while Q matrices come from itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Encoder-Decoder](assets/enc_dec.png){width=50%}"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "8a045c46",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Multi-Headed Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed self-attention, however skipped an important aspect of transformers that is multi-headed attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the same example. The word `it` is correctly identified by the attention outputs to be related to `animal`. But there can be multiple contact points of information and interaction in the same sentence! For example the word `tired` is also related to `animal` but this relationship is not capture in one self-attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be remedied by having multiple attention heads! This means that for a single transformer block, we'll have multiple sets of Q, K, V matrices instead of one. And before passing to the Feed Forward Neural Network, we'll concatenate their outputs to aggregate their information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps us capture multi-tiered information, like shown in this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Attention With Two Heads](assets/att_example2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position Embeddings\n",
    "So far in self-attention, we have not considered the *order* or the *arrangement* of the words in the sentence at all. The model simply looks around for attention irrespective of the query's position. However positional information is important (obviously), so it needs to be incorporated somehow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create one more embedding of size [T, C]. Here, T is the number of words in a sentence, and C is the embedding dimension of the words. We simply add this embedding to the word / token embedding before computing the attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residual Connections and LayerNorm\n",
    "Another component in the transformer architecture is the residual connections and Layer Norm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Layer Norm is different from Batch Normalization, in that latter normalizes using the properties of the entire batch, whereas former normalizes using the properties of the embedding dimension.\n",

    "## Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder components are exactly the same as encoders - except for one change. Between self-attention and FFN, there’s an additional component called cross-attention. In this attention stage, the K and V matrices come from the encoder, while the Q matrices come from the decoder itself. This helps to aggregate the encoded information while decoding the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one more difference with Decoder- while computing the attention, the *future* words are not attended to. That is, while decoding the first word, you cannot get any information from rest of the words. For first two words, no info from the third and onwards. This is implemented using by masking the weights matrix using a lower triangular matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoders, like Encoders, are also stacked one above the another, and the outputs keep bubbling up till the last decoder layer. After that, there’s a linear layer that transforms the embeddings into probabilities across the entire vocabulary. Assume the model’s vocabulary is 10,000. Then for each output word there will be 10,000 probabilities. You can pick the highest probability and call it as your result, and discard the rest. This is called greedy search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beam-Search\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pick the highest probability and call it as your result, and discard the rest. This is called greedy search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, for the first word, you can keep the top two words, “I” and “He”. For the next word, you can run the model twice - one assuming the first word “I” was correct, and the second time assuming “He” was correct. Whichever produced less error considering the two words predicted, is kept. This is called beam search. In our case, beam size was 2- it can be bigger.\n",
