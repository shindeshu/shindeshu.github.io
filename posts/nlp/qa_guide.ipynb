    "\n",
    "![A Greek Sphinx](assets/sphinx_robot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The phenomenon of knowledge being locked is common to almost every organization. Knowledge- institutional, technical, introductory etc. is locked in several documents in several places, and needs active search with much efforts going through tomes in order to understand some piece of lore. What if you had an artificial brain who could digest all of this knowledge, and you simply converse with this brain to understand pieces of your lore-verse?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is no longer science-fiction. Massive language models like ChatGPT have quickly become the norm, and the capabilities of large language models are still being found out. Turns out, you don't always need a service like ChatGPT, and you can service a lot of your needs using open-source models that can run on a single GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using NLP models, not only can you unlock your organizational information by enabling intelligent search over large corpora, but can build question-answering apps on top of them, so information retrieval can be automated to an astonishing degree. Q&A apps are one of the best ways to make sense of text data. In this post, we'll go over this particular application of question-answering, alongwith some basic code to show how to implement them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contents**: This post gives an overview of the types of question-answering tasks. It covers the different components in a question answering pipeline, alongwith some basic code implementations, reference libraries and examples.\n",

    "## Types of Question-Answering Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to divide Question-Answering applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open-Book vs Closed-Book\n",
    "2. Extractive vs Generative\n",
    "\n",
    "### üïÆ Open-Book and Closed-Book\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of Q&A task is where you give a context/document to the model, as well as the question. The model then gives you an answer to the question. Since you are giving a context alongwith the question to the model, this is called an open-book QA task. The model answers the question only using the information given. This is analogous to open-book exams, where you are allowed to bring a book to the exam. Then there's closed-book task where you are not given any context, the model is supposed to answer based on the information is has stored in itself. Because we are passing a ground truth in open-book tasks, they usually perform better, and hence are the preferred setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: Giving the context is extra trouble- what if I have thousands of documents? How can the model find answer through thousands of documents? Let's answer this question in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üñãÔ∏è Extractive vs Generative\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we come to the second classification- Extractive vs Generative. In Extractive QA, the answer will be a sentence/phrase from the given document. It will not create new words/sentences, but simply find the most relevant text in the context and return it. Hence it is sort of an advanced search algorithm that retrieves the section you need from the document. Because the returned phrase exists in the ground truth, this method is useful when you need accurate, small answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In generative QA, the model will craft an answer based on it's understanding of the context, instead of simply returning an existing phrase. Because the model is generating text, it is more prone to making errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of above applications, the returned answers tend to be small, one-liners. Long-form QA is a variant of generative QA, where the answers are supposed to be long.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Small Example\n",
    "This is a small example of an extractive QA. Note that the pipeline requires both a context and the question."

    "## Components of QA Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the problem with open-book answering- each question needs a reference document, which cannot be provided manually. The solution is to use another model to retrieve the most relevant document to the question, which then another model can use to do the answering. Hence this becomes a two-stage system, a retriever followed by a reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "QA systems will hence have these components- \n",
    "\n",
    "- a database of documents (your knowledge base)\n",
    "- a retriever component (to retrieve relevant documents)\n",
    "- an optional reranker component (to re-order the relevant documents)\n",
    "- a reader component (to extract the answer) or a generator component (to generate an answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using a large language model like GPT-3, this could as simple as a single generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a diagram that summarizes these components as well as how they're put together:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Overview of QA Systems](assets/qa3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üïµüèª‚Äç Retriever - How Find the Relevant Documents\n",
    "Let's say you want to build a question-answering system on a bunch of internal documentation. The documentation is a pile of thousands of documents. To get an answer, you need to pass a question, and alongwith a passage that is relevant to that question. Since finding the passage is a huge task in itself, how is the QA app helpful at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to let a model handle this task as well. This will be a different model than the QA model, and will be called \"retriever\". All the documents will be passed to this model to get embeddings for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n",
    "## What Are Embeddings? (Click to Expand)\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding is a numerical/vector representation of an entity, in this case a document. Embeddings of two similar documents will be closer to each other numerically.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we pass a question, we'll compute the embeddings of the question as well. We'll find the closest documents to the given question by comparing their embeddings. This is how finding relevant documents is automated using a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the relevant document is in itself an application. Sometimes you don't need a QA on top, finding a needle in the haystack is beneficial in itself. This is called \"Semantic Search\", and is extremely easy to implement with a significant improvement in productivity."

    "### ‚öñ Reranking\n",
    "For thousands and millions of documents, the performance of a retriever alone can be insufficient. It could return documents that may be related to some keywords in the query, but not related to the query at all. In order to enhance the results of our search, we could do reranking of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retriever returns us a list of 100 documents, and reranker will again evaluate which of these 100 are most relevant to the query. Reranking has been proven to significantly improve the results for tasks like QA. However an extra model will be compute-intensive too. If the number of documents is not too high, re-ranking may not be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úçüèª Get Answer Using Reader / Generator\n",
    "Now that you have a context for the given question, you can pass both to a QA model that can (extract or generate) answer. But first, let us define this \"Reader\" model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is an extractive QA, i.e. highlighting the relevant phrase, you can use models like BERT fine-tuned on open-source QA datasets like SQuAD. If this is a generative QA, we use a model like BART/T5/GPT-2 \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n",
    "## The Types of Transformers (Click to Expand)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of transformer models: Encoder, Decoder, and encoder-decoder. Encoders, like BERT, are suited to understand given text, Decoders like GPTs are suited to generate new text, Encoder-Decoders like BART/T5 are suited to generate text based on given texts.\n",

    "It's a natural question- how is question-answering different from a chatbot? A chatbot is a lot of things - it could be a very simple lookup tool, or a massive ChatGPT. A chatbot may not always need a sophisticated transformer-based approach. You could build a simple chatbot that identifies the query and maps it to internal FAQs, and reply with options instead of a natural language reply. Conversational AI also needs to have some session memory, i.e. being able to remember the history of the conversation.\n",

Generally, those abilities should transfer to any domain, but fine-tuning can give you massive boosts in performance.

A lot depends on the budget- if it's an enterprise application where a paid GPT-3 API is available, there are libraries like LangChain or GPT-Index that abstract away a lot of boilerplate code and let you easily build a question-answering chain in a few lines of code. LangChain also supports some other open-source huggingface models.\n",

    "- **Lot of Cloud Compute** - If using a paid GPT-3 API is not possible, but there's budget enough for several GPUs- you can use open-source large language models like Flan-T5, OPT-IML, GPT-J/Neo etc. Huggingface hosts all of these, and is really easy to use and fine-tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Free-tier Google Colab** - If you want to build a simple prototype on the free-tier of Google Colab, you'd be off to using the smaller models. Models like Flan-T5 do quite well even at small sizes. Generative QA don't do that well at these sizes, but if fine-tuning could do the trick. "
